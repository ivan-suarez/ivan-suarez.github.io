                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Ivan. I'm a web developer from rainy Asturias, Spain. I am, like you, just trying to
                    survive Modernity. I'm interested in AI, architecture, space exploration and anime. While I live in a
                    small city I'm a big fan of huge metropolis like Tokyo and Singapore.</p>
                <p>Some facts about me:

                    <ul>
                        <li>I don't have a favorite programming language. I mostly use Java, Javascript and Python and all have things I dislike. I have used C and C# in college but I didn't delve into them.</li>
                        <li>My fav distro is Manjaro because it just werks. I use i3 as a window manager.</li>
                        <li>I speak Spanish, English and French. I'm learning Japanese and German.</li>
                        <li>Fav games: Nier Automata</li>
                        <li>Fav anime: Code Geass</li>
                        <li>Fav novel: The Red and The Black</li>
                        <li>Fav poem: Prometheus by Goethe</li>
                        <li>As for music, these days I mostly listen to kpop and videogame/anime soundtracks. I used to be a big metalhead and sometimes I listen to it from time to time.</li>
                        <li>I'm not a big movie guy but probably the film I watched repeatedly the most is Alfie (2004).</li>
                    </ul>
