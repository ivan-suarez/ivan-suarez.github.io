                <h3>Thoughts on post-scarcity</h3>
                <p><em>Posted on January 15, 2023</em></p>

                    Mercancy is produced through work leveraged by capital and resources. As automatization increases, work
                    gets cheapers. It will get to a point where there are no operational costs and only capital. This can go
                    different ways. One, the only way to get money is through having capital, be it land or automated
                    machinery, and the proletary class turns into an UBI one. Two, you can leverage a small amount of
                    capital to a bigger one, if you have access to resources you can extract. Resources on Earth are finite,
                    but the Universe should be big enough. So sovereign humans would colonize other planets and form
                    societies through pure will.

                <h3>Thoughts on science fiction</h3>
                <p><em>Posted on February 20, 2023</em></p>
                <p>
                    I'm dissapointed by how stagnated is the scifi-genre. There seem to be three subgenres: space opera,
                    post-apocalypsis and cyberpunk. The latter has been the most prevalent for a while, producing hundreds
                    of Blade Runner clones. Now, there is a subset of cyberpunk I find interesting, which I call "clean
                    dystopia", in which a dystopian place looks utopic at first glance. Some examples that I can think of
                    are Gattaca and Mirror's Edge. While these fictional societies aren't desirable, at least they offer a
                    nice aesthetic experience, which can be inspiring. But at the end, all offer pessimistic views about
                    technology and the future. In contrast with this, there is this new subgenre, solarpunk, which I find
                    extremely boring. Take a contemporary asian metropolis and spam trees and windmills and you get the
                    whole thing. Add some sense of "community" for some feels-good moralism. It's corporate trash. But I
                    think there is a room for a new utopian aesthetic, and we already have the building blocks. Recently I
                    played Final Fantasy VIII, and in particular I loved Balamb's Garden and the city of Esthar.
