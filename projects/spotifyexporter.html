                        I created this project with the objective of trying out Next.js. Previously when I tried out the
                Twitter API
                using Vue I had CORS issues so I had to make a Node.js backend as an intermediary, so using a
                fullstack
                framework like Next.js seemed like a good idea.
                First thing I created a quick wireframe of the application in Figma. I only need two screens:
                one for login with
                spotify and the other one for displaying the playlists. On top of that I decide to add a modal
                to show the
                playlists tracks because who doesn't love modals?
                So I proceed to implement the OAuth flow. I realized I installed typescript, which I didn't even
                use fully since
                the spotify API library didn't support the language yet.
                For styling I choose Tailwind CSS, which I found a bit lackluster.
