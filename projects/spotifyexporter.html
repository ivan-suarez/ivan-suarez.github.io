        I created this project with the objective of trying out Next.js. Previously when I tried out the Twitter API
        using Vue I had CORS issues so I had to make a Node.js backend as an intermediary, so using a fullstack
        framework like Next.js seemed like a good idea.
        First thing I created a quick wireframe of the application in Figma. I only need two screens: one for login with
        spotify and the other one for displaying the playlists. On top of that I decide to add a modal to show the
        playlists tracks because who doesn't love modals?
        So I proceed to implement the OAuth flow. I realized I installed typescript, which I didn't even use fully since
        the spotify API library didn't support the language yet.
        For styling I choose Tailwind CSS, which I found a bit lackluster.
