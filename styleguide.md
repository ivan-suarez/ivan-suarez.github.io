Y2K Futuristic Website Style Guide

    Aesthetic Theme:
    A fusion of early 2000s digital futurism, cyber UI elements, and sleek, minimal architecture. The design should evoke the visual language of PS2/PS3-era racing games (Ridge Racer, Gran Turismo), cyberpunk user interfaces, and the sterile yet high-tech environments of Mirror’s Edge and Nier: Automata.

    Color Palette:
        Dominantly cool tones: white, silver, icy blue, and turquoise.
        Accents in high-contrast red, neon yellow, and black.
        Occasional deep blue or purple gradients for depth.
        Background must be light.

    Typography:
        Clean, futuristic sans-serif fonts.
        Consider using Eurostile, Bank Gothic, or custom monospaced typefaces for a technical feel.
        Optional glitch or pixel-style typography for UI elements.

    Layout & Grid:
        Highly structured, grid-based design with sharp geometric divisions.
        Heavy use of asymmetric layouts, floating panels, and HUD-inspired elements.
        Glassmorphism and semi-transparent overlays to give depth and layering.

    UI Elements:
        Buttons: Rectangular, flat, or semi-transparent with subtle shadows. Hover effects should be minimal but smooth.
        Menus & Navbars: Floating or side-aligned, resembling in-game UI panels from PS2/PS3 racing and action games.
        Icons: High-tech, vector-based icons with simple linework.

    Backgrounds & Textures:
        Abstract digital landscapes or cyber-futuristic cityscapes (inspired by Mirror’s Edge).
        Grid overlays, blueprint-style wireframes, and subtle noise or VHS effects.
        Modular architecture, drawing inspiration from contemporary minimalist buildings.

    Effects & Motion:
        Subtle motion effects: smooth slide-ins, opacity fades, and digital-style UI animations.
        Cursor-tracking elements with a HUD-style reticle or cyber UI glow.
        Glitch effects sparingly applied to images or interactive components.

    Inspirations:
        PS1/PS2 UI aesthetics (Ridge Racer 7, Ace Combat 2, Gran Turismo 4).
        Cyberpunk and dystopian interfaces (Nier: Automata, Metal Gear Solid, Armored Core).
        Modernist and modular architecture (inspired by the white cubic structures in the moodboard).
        The clean, high-speed world of Mirror’s Edge.
